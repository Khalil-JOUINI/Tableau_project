BESOINS DE DATA POUR COM LA FAMILLE (Dashboards)
I am thrilled to share a project I've been working on, it's an operational communication agency specializing in reaching out to children and families across various sectors like toys, 
publishing, leisure, and non-profit.

üìä Project Overview: Enhancing Operational Efficiency with Tableau

In our relentless pursuit of comprehending and catering to our clients' needs, we pinpointed crucial data requirements that propelled us into a Tableau-driven exploration.

üîç Data Needs: Unlocking the Power of Information

Showcasing our Network Knowledge: Our goal is to demonstrate a deep understanding of the network of child-friendly locations. 
This includes schools, leisure centers, sports clubs, and school cafeterias. Tableau helps us visualize and present this information to clients and prospects, 
enabling personalized approaches.

Optimizing Advertising Campaigns: A centralized system is essential for tracking and analyzing each advertising campaign comprehensively. 
Historical data, order information, conversion rates, and customer data all in one place provide a holistic view, 
identifying trends and offering in-depth customer insights for both pre-sales and operational phases.

Transparency and Client Impact: Tableau becomes our ally in providing total transparency to clients, showcasing the impact of each campaign and enabling highly personalized approaches.
